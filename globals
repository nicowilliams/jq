All globals are in execute.c and are used only via what should/will be
API functions: jq_next() and jq_teardown().

These:

    data_stk
    fork_stk
    frame_stk

are used in stack_{push, pop, save, switch, restore}(), and jq_next()
and jq_teardown().  The stack_*() functions are only reachable via
jq_next() and jq_teardown.

These:

    pathbuf
    pathsize

are used in path_push(), which is called from jq_next(), and in
jq_next() and jq_teardown().

TODO:

 - put all of these into a struct that gets passed into jq_next() and
   jq_teardown().

 - make jq_init() allocate that struct.
